# Lasership Tracking Program
A simple python script to automatically track a lasership delivery and ring an alarm when the package is delivered. 

## Usage
The program is very lightweight and easy to use. Steps-
1. Clone the repository
2. Update the tracking number in `main.py`
3. Use `pip` to install requests
4. Run program using `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` (depending on your env setup)

Now the program can run in the background and will ring an alarm when the package is delivered. No more waiting/refreshing the tracking page every 5 minutes. :)
